# Abstract
This research paper examines and describes the factors that lead the financial institutions, banking and non-banking institutions, in Haiti to reluctantly lend money or to apply credit rationing to micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses on CAPOIS street and in the whereabouts. It also focuses on the fact that the micro-enterprises and SME haven’t been often enough the benefactors of loans. The survey through questionnaires has been designed and utilized to collect data from respondents – they call them managers or owners of Micro and SME- in order to understand the portion, not sufficient enough, of businesses granted loans for their economic activities. Consequently, the analyses will be made from a different perspective rather than if the data were collected from the financial institutions or both.
In this article, the micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises are targeted to comprehend the various aspects of MSME that the financial institutions prioritize or might not to supply loans. Thus, the main focus is to see to what extent the accounting business structure (qualitative or quantitative) might be an obstacle to financing.
 The results show that, when considering the total of businesses on Capois street and nearby, only a small portion has benefited from credit. From the results, some relations between variables are considered to elucidate our arguments.
One of the purposes of this article is to seek equally to understand the characteristics of the small portion of businesses that has suffered from the lack of access to credit in general.  In a nutshell, this research paper explores various elements that categorize those who benefit from credit and those who don’t.
We have integrated, in this research paper, econometric and statistical analyses to study closely the phenomenon. The results show positive relations between credits and any collateral and other types to guarantee the bank or the microfinance. They also show positive relations between education and loans. In a pure and simple fashion, the more educated is the owner, the more loans he is prone to have.

Keywords: credit rationing, micro and SME relation, informal sector, information asymmetries, logistic regression for credit rationing, credit risk.
